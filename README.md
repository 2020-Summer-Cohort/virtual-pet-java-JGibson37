# Virtual Pet

The goal of Virtual Pet is to create a program simulating taking care of a pet. The program must contain :
   
   1. A VirtualPet class, in that class you must at least:
        1.Create a tick() method that represents the passage of time.
        2.Create at least three instance variables (aka attributes aka properties aka fields).
        3.Create at least three methods (messages you send to your pet).
    2. A VirtualPetApp class, in that class you must at least:
        Create a main method thatâ€¦
        1.implements a game loop.
        2.asks for user input.
        3.writes output to the console.
      
I started off by implementing a game loop, and acquiring a user input. After that I implemented a break in
the loop by adding a if userInput = 0 statement with a break inside of it. After successfully ending my loop 
I moved on to creating methods to call, and created variables to manipulate. Lastly I implemented the required
Tick methods to advance the game state. At this point, all required tasks have been completed, so I formatted
my code, and removed extraneous comments.
